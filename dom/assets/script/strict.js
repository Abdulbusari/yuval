// Welcome to JavaScript (single line comment)

/*
    JavaScript was designed to be easy for novice programmers to use. For that
    reason, JavaScript differs from some other programming languages, such as
    Java, which demand strict application of rules for syntax and program
    structure. Some JavaScript lapses in syntax are resolved in a way that it
    is not fatal to the programâ€™s execution. While this is attractive to novice
    programmers, it does encourage a certain degree of laxness in coding.
    Many developers advocate that JavaScript be run in strict mode in which all
    lapses in syntax result in load-time or run-time errors. Using strict mode
    encourages good programming technique and also makes the script run more
    efficiently and faster. To run a script in strict mode, add the following
    statement to the first line of the file: "use strict";
    For future projects, you apply strict mode to the JavaScript code you create
